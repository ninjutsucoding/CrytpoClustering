# CrytpoClustering
Module 19 - Unsupervised Learning

Most of the code was made looking at the assignments from Week 19.  

I used XLA to get the code at the beginning to fix the KMeans error problem.

I know the values are a little different from the scaled and the PCA but the elbow curve data was exactly the same.
